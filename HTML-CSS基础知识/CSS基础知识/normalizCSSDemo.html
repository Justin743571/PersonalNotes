      Thank you so much for putting this crash course out for free. I'm in
      school learning all back-end Java type data structures and algorithms but
      they haven't taught us ANYTHING about front-end besides some old JavaFX
      type projects. This was exactly what I needed to get familiar with HTML
      and CSS and start to i guess... know what I don't know haha. Cheers!
